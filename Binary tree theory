Binary Tree is defined as a Tree data structure with at most 2 children. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left 
and right child.
A Binary tree is represented by a pointer to the topmost node of the tree. If the tree is empty, then the value of the root is NULL.

Binary Tree node contains the following parts:

Data
Pointer to left child
Pointer to right child

Unlike linear data structures (Array, Linked List, Queues, Stacks, etc) which have only one logical way to traverse them, trees can be traversed in different ways.
The following are the generally used methods for traversing trees:
Inorder Traversal 
Preorder Traversal
Postorder Traversal
